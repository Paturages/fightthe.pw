  subtitle: Clone Hero-friendly Organized Repository of User-provided Songs
  description: chorus is a search engine for Guitar Hero/Clone Hero custom charts. It scrapes drive folders from community contributors to gather and centralize access to their custom-made charts and provides an interface to easily retrieve them upon request. A chart is the technical term attached to a transcription of any real song to just a few notes, usually 5, that Guitar Hero-style games like to use. chorus gathered about 5,000 daily users in December 2018.

- title: kerfuffle
  subtitle: A /r/visualnovels Dies Irae contest entry
  description: This was a self-imposed "hackathon" to see how much of a proof-of-concept "game" I could implement in just a dozen hours. kerfuffle is a very basic, barebones Disgaea/Fire Emblem/Dofus-like game that somehow leverages React features for game status management. It is also one of the weebest things I've ever done.

  subtitle: Barebones, minimalistic date picker
  description: ng-ucldr is a very basic date picker for AngularJS (1.x) I implemented for personal needs, and packaged for npm later on to test the npm system. Nothing really special, but just one way to have a date picker in about 200 lines of code.
