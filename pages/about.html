<p>
  Yup, this is me. I'm currently chilling somewhere in Paris, France, making my living as a software developer,
  mainly in (full-stack) web development. I'm also doing various development for personal projects,
  as well as contributing for many ongoing projects.
</p>

<p>
  I'm also an active contributor to the <a href="https://clonehero.net">Clone Hero</a> community,
  as the developer and maintainer of <a href="https://chorus.fightthe.pw" target="_blank">chorus</a>
  and the Clone Hero website itself, as a chart reviewer, as a CH Discord staff member and as a member
  of <i>Custom Songs Central</i> and the <i>Anti Hero</i> team.
</p>

<h3>...fight the power?</h3>

<p>
  In the quest of finding catchy domain names, I registered fightthe.pw on a whim (and because it cost $0.99
  for a year at the time), and ended up renewing and keeping it for posterity sake. If you needed any confirmation,
  this is indeed a callback to the lyrics of <i>Libera me from Hell</i>, from the <i>Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</i> OST.
</p>

<h3>Web development</h3>

<p>
  I've been a full stack web developer since 2016, graduating in computer science from an engineering school
  (with, somehow, a specialization in embedded systems). I've worked my way up from self-learning AngularJS (1.x)
  to adopting React, while also gradually learning about ECMAScript 2015+ and using Node.js for server-side.
  I won't claim to be a master in the art of development, but I'd like to think I'm at least quite experienced
  with web development in general.
</p>

<h3>Clone Hero community</h3>

<p>
  As the developer and maintainer of <a href="https://chorus.fightthe.pw" target="_blank">chorus</a>,
  I also arrange and facilitate promotion for charters, the main content providers of the platform.
  As a chart reviewer, I'm also part of leading efforts to guarantee a high level of quality among chart providers.
  As a member of <i>Custom Songs Central</i>, I also contribute as a full-fledged charter to add to the pool of songs
  that can be played on Clone Hero.
</p>

<h3>Charting for Clone Hero</h3>

<p>
  I do have some musical training (8 years of piano and music theory) that I decided to put to use through putting
  notes on songs for Guitar Hero-like games. I started around 2008, being strangely inspired by the Frets on Fire
  community, then moved on to become one of the major charters for the late JamLegend. I also took the role of
  chart reviewer for JamLegend at the time.
</p>

<p>
  Cue in the inevitable fall of all communities involved and my own studies, which fast-forwards the story to 2017,
  when I was made aware of the existence of Clone Hero, which spawned a revival of the former Guitar Hero community.
  It was the perfect time for me to make a comeback in the charting scene!
