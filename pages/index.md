Hi, I'm [Paturages](/about), and this is my personal website!

This website features:
* [A **Portfolio**](/projects): a showcase of the personal work I have done, mostly in web development
* [A **Blog**](/blog): I'm not really that talkative, nor do I have much inspiration to write insightful articles, but nevertheless, this website does feature, for whatever reason, a blog.
* [**Clone Hero/Guitar Hero charts**](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1zOyCmyWasNlykkktMWU6tutQtgRivSFw): *"charting"* is the technical term attached to transcribing real songs to just a few notes, usually 5, that Guitar Hero-style games like to use. There's a dedicated and talented community behind artfully and accurately attaching the best matching notes to any particular song. These are my own contributions to this community.
