I don't really have an exact release date of chorus, since it was really launched on a whim and quite hastily, but let's say *chorus* is 1 year old now! Woo!

To celebrate, this article is going to go through the very origins of *chorus*. For that, we're going to study the many ways you could (and for the most part still can) get custom charts for your *Clone Hero* library. I'm also gonna give my own insights about them, which spawned the idea, then the first version of *chorus*.

## So, what the hell is *chorus?*

In one straight sentence, *chorus* is a platform that aggregates community custom charts and provides an interface to search through them. This is the main utility and principle of *chorus*, and what most of its users came to expect of it. Nothing less, nothing more.

## How did it come to be?

Early December 2017. Let's say you're a new player looking for some charts.

There were a few ways of getting charts, each with their own setbacks:

### [The *spreadsheet*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13B823ukxdVMocowo1s5XnT3tzciOfruhUVePENKc01o/edit#gid=0)

A curated list of drive folders containing vast amounts of charts and songs, either from the community or ripped from official games. A great way to get started, and arguably still to this day, the one starting point as a new player to get charts.

At the time, if you went and decided to get *all* of the songs from all of the drives, you'd end up with maybe a bit under 20,000 charts, which would get you going forever. But what if you were looking for *that one particular song you loved when you were a kid?* What about that newly released album: has anyone from the community charted it yet? What if you couldn't spare the disk space for all of these songs?

### [C3](http://customscreators.com/index.php?/page/index.html)

Custom Creators Collective (C3) is the main platform that hosts and manages the Rock Band customs community. It totals a little bit under 19,000 charts. C3 is a well-featured platform that notably allows you to search through its database for any particular song you might be searching for.

However, it is most and foremost tailored for Rock Band players: to play these charts on Clone Hero, you would need to [convert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-r2s-etFQQ&feature=youtu.be) them using an external tool if they did not provide a compatible download.

C3 at the time was not too Clone Hero-aware. The only reason one could play their customs on Clone Hero was that they provided support for [Phase Shift](http://www.dwsk.co.uk/index_phase_shift.html), another Guitar Hero-type game that was successful before Clone Hero. Clone Hero conveniently supports songs that were compatible with Phase Shift, and that's how you could (and still can) utilize C3 charts to build upon your library. This is incidentally why you need to pick "Phase Shift converter" in the converter tool.

### The C3 conversions drive folder

So what if I were too lazy to convert them, or what if all of this was too confusing to me? You shouldn't need to know the legacy of the Guitar Hero/Rock Band community to get started!

The C3 conversions drive folder was a great effort lead by CaGe666 and ZeroHearts at the time, which is now down because it could not be maintained anymore. These people went through the process of manually converting packs of songs and uploading them on a centralized Google Drive, doing weekly releases, which helped keep the community on its toes.

The main feature of this Google Drive was how it categorized all of its songs from A to Z, according to their artist name. So if you were looking for a particular band's name, you would just navigate to the corresponding letter folder and navigate to that band!

One problem stems from Google Drive itself: its search feature doesn't search in all the subfolders. You have to access a subfolder for Google Drive to actually recognize it as a folder that has been shared to you, and that you can search through. Not ideal if you're looking for a song but you forgot its artist.

**This is actually the main reason and idea that spawned chorus.** I wanted to be able to search through that drive seamlessly, so I started sifting through the Google Drive API documentation and deemed the project feasible at the time.

### Frets on Fire forums

"Frets on Fire" was the first majorly known Guitar Hero-like game that got wildly popular at the time, between 2007 and 2011. Its forums were the most major contributors

### Individual charter drives

Among the aforementioned spreadsheet, there are quite a few individual charters listed, and their drives are all separate from each other, because they of course have to be self-managed by the charter themselves.

The CH Discord has a charter role that is held in high regards: it is difficult to get because of high standards, and getting it pretty much certifies your status as an accomplished charter among the community. Therefore, the quality of the charts you can get through these individual charter drives is almost guaranteed to be good, which could not be said of previously mentioned source of charts. The reasons why they couldn't are worth their own individual article.

### #chart-requests

The channel #chart-requests on the CH Discord was created on December 2017 because of an excess influx of chart requests, whether already existing or not, in #charting.
